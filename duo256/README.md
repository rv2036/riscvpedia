# Welcome, RISC-V Users and Documentation Contributors!

This file is a placeholder and a simple guide for submitting new articiles and tutorials.

Every doc has a `.md` file and (optionally) a `.files` subfolder.

The commons images (e.g. the logo of Jiachen Project) can be found in `/img`.

markdown is the default format. If you wanna different format (e.g. asciidoc or rST), please make sure the new file formats not breaking the CI of riscvpedia project.
